- Add or remove processes as needed (supports up to 10 processes)
- Set time quantum for Round Robin algorithm

### 2. **Select Algorithm**
- Choose from 6 different scheduling algorithms
- Switch between algorithms to compare results
- View algorithm-specific explanations

### 3. **Analyze Results**
- **Gantt Chart**: Visual timeline of process execution
- **Performance Metrics**: 
  - Average Waiting Time
  - Average Turnaround Time
  - CPU Utilization
  - Throughput
- **Step-by-step Explanation**: Understand the decision-making process

---

## 📊 Performance Metrics Explained

### ⏱️ **Turnaround Time**
The total time from process arrival to completion
```
Turnaround Time = Completion Time - Arrival Time
```

### ⏳ **Waiting Time**
The time a process spends waiting in the ready queue
```
Waiting Time = Turnaround Time - Burst Time
```

### 🎯 **CPU Utilization**
Percentage of time the CPU is busy executing processes
```
CPU Utilization = (Total CPU Time / Total Time) × 100%
```
